        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15272v1">Superheavy dark matter from the natural inflation in light of the highest-energy astroparticle events</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-04-21</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohta Murase, Yuma Narita, Wen Yin</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The study proposes a model where superheavy dark matter acts as both the inflaton in natural inflation and a decaying particle producing high-energy particles (10⁹–10¹³ GeV), with a scalar field reviving inflation by diluting dark matter abundance, while multi-messenger constraints, links to cosmic events (e.g., AMATERASU, KM3NeT), and testable predictions (UHECR components, spectral indices, collider-accessible particles) suggest cosmic ray observations could reveal insights into dark matter and inflation.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15222v1">Did DESI DR2 truly reveal dynamical dark energy?</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-04-21</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deng Wang, David Mota</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite the DESI collaboration's reported evidence for evolving dark energy (DDE) from combined datasets, independent analyses reveal dataset tensions that weaken their claim, instead strongly favoring DDE over ΛCDM but challenging cosmic acceleration's significance and dark energy's negative pressure, suggesting the universe's fate may be matter-dominated.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15104v1">Search for pulsars with periods of more than two seconds at declinations from +21$^o$ to +42$^o$</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-04-21</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. A. Tyul'bashev, G. E. Tyul'basheva</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A five-year pulsar search using the Large Phased Array at 111 MHz over 6300 sq.deg., employing the Fast Folding Algorithm and combined periodograms for sensitivity, detected 9 of 14 known pulsars and discovered 2 new ones (including the nearby J1951+28), concluding that the scarcity of long-period pulsars outside the Galactic plane suggests minute-scale periodic sources are likely white dwarfs.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15011v1">Quasi-thermal Photosphere Emission from Structured Jets of Gamma-Ray Bursts</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-04-21</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ding-Fang Hu, Jin-Jun Geng, Hao-Xuan Gao, Jing-Zhi Yan, Xue-Feng Wu</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study numerically calculates the photosphere emission spectra of structured gamma-ray burst jets from various viewing angles, revealing quasi-thermal components and the necessity of proper outflow boundary treatment, while predicting that instruments like the Einstein Probe and SVOM can detect off-axis short GRBs similar to GRB 170817A within 200Mpc if the viewing angle is under 10 degrees.</p>

        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-04-21</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin-Ke Hu, Jia-Xuan Li, Yu-Wei Yu, Ji-Shun Lian, Wei Deng, Hai-Ming Zhang, Jin Zhang</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observed high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac H 1426+428 in two epochs, detecting no significant polarization (upper limit <19.5%) in the first observation but a 7.1σ polarized X-ray signal (20.6% ± 2.9%) with stable angle during the second, higher-flux, harder-spectrum state, attributed to shock-accelerated electrons in ordered magnetic fields, with the initial non-detection likely due to low photon counts.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14705v1">Black Hole Survival Guide: Searching for Stars in the Galactic Center That Endure Partial Tidal Disruption</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-04-20</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rewa Clark Bush, Samantha C. Wu, Rosa Wallace Everson, Ricardo Yarza, Ariadna Murguia-Berthier, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study employs 3D hydrodynamic and 1D stellar evolution simulations to demonstrate that remnants of partial tidal disruption events (TDEs) by supermassive black holes initially exhibit a brief, hyper-luminous phase—potentially explaining the Milky Way's enigmatic G objects—before cooling into long-lived stars with metal-enriched envelopes detectable through spectroscopy, offering insights into extreme gravitational interactions.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14592v1">The fate of the progenitors of Luminous Red Novae: Infrared detection of LRNe years after the outburst</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-04-20</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Reguitti, A. Pastorello, G. Valerin</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Late-time observations of nine extragalactic Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) reveal that post-outburst survivors fade optically but remain bright in near- and mid-infrared for years, with color evolution indicating dust formation (0.1-30×10⁻⁶ M☉, 350-770 K) and components like stellar remnants, cool dust, and IR echoes.</p>

        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cosimo Bambi</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The author suggests that an interstellar mission to send small spacecraft to the nearest black hole, though highly speculative and currently technologically unfeasible, could become viable within 20-30 years, potentially providing invaluable data on black holes and General Relativity through an 80-100 year journey.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14502v1">Red Supergiant problem viewed from the nebular phase spectroscopy of type II supernovae</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-04-20</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiliang Fang, Takashi J. Moriya, Keiichi Maeda</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study reassesses the red supergiant (RSG) problem using late-phase spectroscopy of 50 Type II supernovae, revealing an upper luminosity cutoff (log L/L☉ = 5.21) and a progenitor mass limit below ~25 M☉, suggesting the observed lack of luminous RSG progenitors reflects a genuine physical issue.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14433v1">The impact of ultraviolet suppression on the rates and properties of strongly lensed Type IIn supernovae detected by LSST</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-04-20</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrés I. Ponte Pérez, Graham P. Smith, Matt Nicholl, Nikki Arendse, Dan Ryczanowski, Suhail Dhawan, the LSST Strong Lensing Science Collaboration</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The study reveals that accounting for UV suppression in Type IIn supernovae due to line-blanketing and scattering effects reduces LSST's predicted annual detection of lensed events from ~70 (under a pure blackbody model) to 60-80%, with ~10 bright, early-detected cases suitable for spectroscopic follow-up.</p>
