        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05444v1">The soft X-ray transient EP241021a: a cosmic explosion with a complex off-axis jet and cocoon from a massive progenitor</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulia Gianfagna, Luigi Piro, Gabriele Bruni, Aishwarya Linesh Thakur, Hendrik Van Eerten, Alberto Castro-Tirado, Yong Chen, Ye-hao Cheng, Han He, Shumei Jia, Zhixing Ling, Elisabetta Maiorano, Rosita Paladino, Roberta Tripodi, Andrea Rossi, Shuaikang Yang, Jianghui Yuan, Weimin Yuan, Chen Zhang</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This multi-wavelength study of X-ray Flash EP241021a's afterglow reveals multiple components arising from jet-environment interactions, supporting collapsar models where a relativistic jet transitions to broader cocoon structures shaped by the progenitor’s pre-existing conditions.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05429v1">Theoretical modeling of approximate universality of tidally deformed neutron stars</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takuya Katagiri, Gowtham Rishi Mukkamala, Kent Yagi</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The study demonstrates that neutron stars exhibit quasi-universal relations among tidal deformabilities, explained through a semi-analytic Tolman VII-based model, where suppressed equation-of-state dependence due to low compressibility underpins these relations, including the I-Love relation, aligning with prior empirical results.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05400v1">Significant reflection and absorption effects in the X-ray emission of the Intermediate Polar IGR J17195-4100</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elif Şafak, Şölen Balman, Gloria Sala</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> By combining XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data to analyze absorption, scattering, and reflection effects in the Intermediate Polar IGR J17195-4100, this study reveals that electron scattering and ionized/neutral absorption significantly shape its X-ray spectrum, necessitating these factors for accurate modeling of intrinsic emission.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05373v1">Late-blooming magnetars: awakening as ultra-long period objects after a dormant cooling epoch</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur G. Suvorov, Clara Dehman, José A. Pons</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study proposes that "late-blooming" magnetars, which remain dormant for ~0.1 Myr due to core electric currents before Hall-driven crustal failures trigger radio pulses and slow rotation, could explain Galactic ultra-long period transients as a distinct class separate from other magnetars like soft gamma repeaters.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05322v1">The Emergence of Little Red Dots from Binary Massive Black Holes</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohei Inayoshi, Jinyi Shangguan, Xian Chen, Luis C. Ho, Zoltan Haiman</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The study proposes that Little Red Dots (LRDs), characterized by v-shaped spectra, originate from compact binary black holes with mini-disks and a circum-binary disk, explaining their spectral features via disk structures, resolving luminosity overestimations and Soltan argument tension with minimal dust attenuation, and predicting spectral evolution toward gravitational wave-detectable mergers as the binary orbit decays.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05299v1">Hydrodynamic and Electromagnetic Discrepancies between Neutron Star and Black Hole Spacetimes</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Gorard, James Juno, Ammar Hakim</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The study shows that neutron stars, unlike black holes whose exterior spacetime depends only on mass and spin, exhibit significant qualitative effects in accretion dynamics and quantitative differences in magnetospheric electric fields due to higher multipole moments influenced by their equation of state, with discrepancies exceeding 50% in energy-momentum density and 10% in electric fields, underscoring limitations in applying the Kerr metric to neutron star simulations.</p>

        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhimanyu Susobhanan, Rutger van Haasteren</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper introduces a generalized method for incorporating arbitrary dispersion measure (DM) variation models, including Gaussian processes, into pulsar timing analysis to better address ionized interstellar medium-induced DM noise in wideband datasets, enhancing existing techniques used in pulsar timing arrays.</p>

        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This review examines hadronic, hybrid, and quark matter models of neutron star equations of state, analyzing their assumptions, predictions, and constraints through a synthesis of recent theoretical and observational studies to provide a comprehensive overview of methodologies, implications, and future research directions.</p>

        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Run-Ting Huang, Long Ji, Jing-Zhi Yan</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A 2021 giant outburst in the high-mass X-ray binary EXO 2030+375 caused a dramatic orbital phase shift of Type-I outburst peaks from near periastron to 20 days post-periastron, followed by gradual recovery and intermittent missing outbursts, likely linked to precession of an eccentric Be disk.</p>

        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niek Bollemeijer, Phil Uttley, Bei You</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In August 2023, the black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8-1613 exhibited strong X-ray variability with energy-dependent type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), showing opposite waveform evolution below and above 15–20 keV due to a pivoting spectral component, distinct phase lags at harmonic frequencies, and spectral-timing similarities to MAXI J1535-571, suggesting shared QPO properties among a subset of sources.</p>
