        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14782v1">A Neural Operator-Based Emulator for Regional Shallow Water Dynamics</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-02-20</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Rivera-Casillas, Sourav Dutta, Shukai Cai, Mark Loveland, Kamaljyoti Nath, Khemraj Shukla, Corey Trahan, Jonghyun Lee, Matthew Farthing, Clint Dawson</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The study introduces MITONet, an autoregressive neural emulator that uses dimensionality reduction to efficiently approximate high-dimensional numerical solvers for parameterized, time-dependent partial differential equations, demonstrated through accurate real-time forecasting of coastal tide-driven dynamics with the shallow-water equations and extrapolation in time and parametric space for climate adaptation planning.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14701v1">Catching the wisps: Stellar mass-loss limits from low-frequency radio observations</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-02-20</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanne Bloot, Harish K. Vedantham, Robert D. Kavanagh, Joseph R. Callingham, Benjamin J. S. Pope</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study uses low-frequency radio emission observations from LOFAR, combined with the absence of free-free absorption and a stellar wind model, to establish upper limits on mass-loss rates for 19 M dwarf stars, achieving sensitivity near the solar mass-loss rate and extending constraints to later spectral types and greater distances than previous methods, with potential for scaling to ∼1000 stars using future surveys.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14516v1">MOJAVE -- XXII. Brightness temperature distributions and geometric profiles along parsec-scale AGN jets</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-02-20</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. V. Kravchenko, I. N. Pashchenko, D. C. Homan, Y. Y. Kovalev, M. L. Lister, A. B. Pushkarev, E. Ros, T. Savolainen</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study analyzes 15 GHz VLBA observations from 1994–2019 of 447 AGN jets, finding that their components typically expand conically (R ∝ r^1.02) with brightness temperatures declining as Tb ∝ r^-2.82, while half exhibit non-monotonic profiles due to shocks or helical structures, and transitions to parabolic shapes align with magneto-hydrodynamic acceleration models.</p>

        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-02-18</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Strugarek, E. Shkolnik</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This chapter reviews magnetic star-planet interactions in close-in systems, summarizing observational evidence, their effects on stellar activity and planetary evolution, and advancements in theoretical models using hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical simulations to explain the underlying physical mechanisms driving these interactions.</p>

        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-02-18</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rainer Weinberger, Aklant Bhowmick, Laura Blecha, Greg Bryan, Johannes Buchner, Lars Hernquist, Julie Hlavacek-Larrondo, Volker Springel</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study introduces a two-parameter gas inflow model for black hole accretion in cosmological simulations using a Bayesian forward-modelling approach, demonstrating that while variations in supermassive black hole accretion at low redshifts are minimal, intermediate mass black holes at high redshifts exhibit significant differences in accretion rates and merger distributions.</p>
