        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08667v1">Extreme Jet Beaming Observed in Neutrino-Associated Blazars</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-03-11</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander V. Plavin, Yuri Y. Kovalev, Sergey V. Troitsky</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Neutrino-associated blazars exhibit exceptionally strong jet beaming, with higher Doppler factors, larger Lorentz factors, and smaller viewing angles than typical blazars, indicating that high-energy neutrinos are produced in relativistic jets at sub-parsec distances where acceleration occurs.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08647v1">JWST's First View of Tidal Disruption Events: Compact, Accretion-Driven Emission Lines & Strong Silicate Emission in an Infrared-selected Sample</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-03-11</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Megan Masterson, Kishalay De, Christos Panagiotou, Erin Kara, Anna-Christina Eilers, Muryel Guolo, Wenbin Lu, Armin Rest, Claudio Ricci, Sjoert van Velzen</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> JWST's first MIRI observations of four mid-infrared-selected tidal disruption events (TDEs) reveal highly ionized gas from TDE accretion, strong silicate emissions indicative of optically thin dust, and a short-wavelength excess potentially linked to late-time flare plateaus, advancing insights into circumnuclear environments around dormant supermassive black holes.</p>

        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-03-11</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avijit Chowdhury, Gargi Sen, Sayan Chakrabarti, Santabrata Das</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study investigates how relativistic, low angular momentum accretion flows around supermassive black holes are influenced by dark matter halos with inner density spikes, finding that dark matter enhances disk luminosity—particularly for massive, compact halos—and suggests luminosity measurements can probe dark matter density structures.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08487v1">Physics of Pair Producing Gaps in Black Hole Magnetospheres: Two Dimensional General Relativistic Particle-in-cell Simulations</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-03-11</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yajie Yuan, Alexander Y. Chen, Martin Luepker</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study employs 2D general relativistic particle-in-cell simulations to demonstrate that spark gaps in black hole magnetospheres, influenced by photon spectra, energy density, and magnetic field strength, can generate plasma via particle acceleration and pair cascades, potentially powering TeV flares in M87 and X-ray flares in Sgr A*.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08441v1">Utilizing localized fast radio bursts to constrain their progenitors and the expansion history of the Universe</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-03-11</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sandeep Kumar Acharya, Paz Beniamini</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Using 110 localized fast radio bursts (FRBs) to simultaneously infer the Hubble constant and host galaxy dispersion measures, researchers found current results consistent with both high (CMB) and low (Type Ia supernova) redshift estimates of \( H_0 \), project that 200 FRBs could resolve this discrepancy at 4\( \sigma \), and conclude that host galaxy data favor older progenitors (ruling out sources <10 Myr) with scattering dominated by local environments rather than host properties or redshift.</p>

        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. U. Devanand, Alok C. Gupta, V. Jithesh, Paul J. Wiita, Archana Gupta</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Analyzing 54 XMM-Newton EPIC-PN observations (2001–2023) of 13 TeV-emitting high-energy peaked BL Lacs, the study found log-parabolic models best fit most X-ray spectra, with eight requiring broken power laws indicating spectral hardening and two cases suggesting co-existing synchrotron and inverse Compton components, alongside correlations between spectral parameters.</p>

        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A 10-year study of 96 pulsars at 110 MHz using the LPA LPI telescope detected weak components in two pulsars: PSR J1543+0929 with a three-profile structure and lateral components (amplitudes 0.013, 0.026), and PSR J2234+2114 with a precursor 53° from the main pulse.</p>

        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study, utilizing MeerKAT and FAST telescopes to analyze polarization and dispersion measures of 43 pulsars in 8 Galactic globular clusters, found no evidence of intracluster medium (unlike 47 Tuc), suggesting stringent electron density limits and effective gas removal via pulsar winds or stellar radiation.</p>

        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The study employs XRISM's X-ray microcalorimeter to analyze Circinus X-1, revealing complex spectral features explained by a radiative transfer model of a ~300 km/s photoionized outflow and variable obscuration, constraining the outflow's origin near the accretion disk's edge and suggesting a radiatively-driven mechanism aided by line forces.</p>
