        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20777v1">Utilizing Stellar Mass Estimates to Identify Gravitational Wave Host Galaxies</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-03-26</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Pálfi, G. Dálya, P. Raffai</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study demonstrates that calibrated stellar mass estimation methods using infrared magnitudes efficiently enhance the ranking of host galaxies for gravitational-wave-detected compact binary coalescences, improving identification in ~80% of cases comparably to resource-intensive approaches while offering computational efficiency.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20770v1">Explaining the UV to X-ray correlation in AGN within the framework of X-ray illumination of accretion discs</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-03-26</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Kammoun, I. E. Papadakis, M. Dovčiak, E. Lusso, E. Nardini, G. Risaliti</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The study demonstrates that the observed non-linear UV-X-ray correlation in active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be reproduced by an X-ray illuminated accretion disc model, requiring specific non-uniform distributions of black hole mass, accretion rate, and power transferred from the disc to the corona, with correlations between these parameters and supporting observational evidence.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20696v1">Immortality through the dark forces: Dark-charge primordial black holes as dark matter candidates</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-03-26</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jessica Santiago, Justin Feng, Sebastian Schuster, Matt Visser</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> By incorporating a dark $U(1)$ charge into primordial black holes (PBHs), thereby reducing their Hawking temperature and evaporation rate, this study demonstrates that charged PBHs can survive beyond the universe's current age with masses as low as $10^{-24} M_\odot$, challenging existing Schwarzschild-based constraints and revitalizing their viability as dark matter candidates across a significantly broader mass range.</p>

        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eva Santos</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Pierre Auger Observatory, upgraded to Phase II with a multi-detector array and simulation frameworks like Geant 4 and CORSIKA 7, investigates ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, particles, and multi-messenger astronomy while managing challenges in resource-heavy simulations and machine learning integration.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20597v1">To detect strong nugget with an acoustic array</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-03-26</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoyang Qi, Renxin Xu</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This article proposes acoustic arrays using microphones, hydrophones, or seismographs to detect strong nuggets (SNs)—condensed matter clusters (~10⁶ g) from cosmic origins and potential dark matter candidates—by capturing their impact signals up to 30 km away, enabling the study of their properties and supra-nuclear matter, with applications in meteorite/earthquake sensing and suggesting the HUNT sonar system as a pathfinder.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20577v1">Misalignment of the Lense-Thirring precession by an accretion torque</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-03-26</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. A. Bollimpalli, J. Horák, W. Kluźniak, P. C. Fragile</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study analytically demonstrates that accretion torque from a cold outer disk can alter the precession axis of a hot inner torus around a black hole, causing it to precess around an axis misaligned with both the black hole's spin and the outer disk, thereby challenging the reliability of jet direction as an indicator of spin or disk orientation.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20559v1">Spectral evolution of the narrow emission line components in optical during the 2022 nova eruption of U Scorpii</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-03-26</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katsuki Muraoka, Naoto Kojiguchi, Junpei Ito, Daisaku Nogami, Taichi Kato, Yusuke Tampo, Kenta Taguchi, Keisuke Isogai, Arthur Leduc, Hamish Barker, Terry Bohlsen, Raul Bruzzone, Forrest Sims, James Foster, Mitsugu Fujii, Keith Shank, Pavol A. Dubovsky, Paolo Cazzato, Stéphane Charbonnel, Olivier Garde, Pascal le Dû, Lionel Mulato, Thomas Petit</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spectral analysis of U Scorpii's 2022 nova eruption revealed that narrow Hα and He II emission components emerging between days 6-8, preceding disk eclipses, originated primarily from a persistent nova wind (~1000 km s⁻¹) driving accretion disk expansion during the optical plateau stage, with contributions from disk surface flow, supporting the survival and dynamic reshaping of the disk post-eruption.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20506v1">Common envelopes in massive stars III: The obstructive role of radiation transport in envelope ejection</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-03-26</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mike Y. M. Lau, Ryosuke Hirai, Daniel J. Price, Ilya Mandel, Matthew R. Bate</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The study's 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations of a high-mass (12+3 solar masses) common-envelope system reveal that radiative diffusion markedly suppresses envelope ejection compared to adiabatic models, yielding half the ejected mass (without recombination energy), similar post-plunge-in orbital separation, and substantial remaining bound mass, suggesting subsequent non-adiabatic phases drive further ejection and orbital evolution.</p>
