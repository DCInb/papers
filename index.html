        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05489v1">On the use of the Axelrod formula for thermal electron collisions in Astrophysical Modelling</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-03-07</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leo P. Mulholland, Steven J. Bromley, Connor P. Ballance, Stuart A. Sim, Catherine A. Ramsbottom</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The study re-optimizes the Axelrod approximation for evaluating electron-impact excitation collision strengths using R-matrix data across elements (Fe to higher-Z systems like Te and Pt), revealing significant inaccuracies in collisional-radiative models, varied optimized coefficients, and orbital structure-based trends that could guide future estimates where R-matrix data is unavailable.</p>

        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-03-07</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Dutta, P. C. C. Freire, T. Gautam, N. Wex, A. Ridolfi, D. J. Champion, V. Venkatraman Krishnan, C. -H. Rosie Chen, M. Cadelano, M. Kramer, F. Abbate, M. Bailes, V. Balakrishnan, A. Corongiu, Y. Gupta, P. V. Padmanabh, A. Possenti, S. M. Ransom, L. Zhang</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The updated timing analysis of the binary millisecond pulsar PSR J0514−4002A in NGC 1851, using GMRT and MeerKAT observations, confirms its cluster association, reveals large and increasing spin derivatives suggesting a nearby third body, and provides precise mass measurements (1.39 M⊙ pulsar, 1.08 M⊙ companion) identifying the companion as a massive white dwarf.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05444v1">Sidebands to mHz QPOs in 4U 1626$-$67 in the second spin-down state</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-03-07</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Sharma, Chetana Jain, Biswajit Paul, Aru Beri</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The 2023 *AstroSat* and *NuSTAR* observations of neutron star 4U 1626–67 during its spin-down torque state revealed energy-dependent quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and sidebands, along with a 37 keV cyclotron feature, contrasting with the 2018 spin-up state dominated by red noise and absent QPOs, highlighting torque state-dependent timing properties and mechanisms for QPO generation.</p>

        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The 2023 outburst of black hole transient Swift J1727.8--1613, observed via Insight-HXMT, revealed a transition from the hard intermediate state to the very high state (VHS), characterized by high disk temperatures, a steep power-law spectrum, flares linked to rapid disk flux increases and inner radius expansion, and a synchrotron self-Compton origin for the non-thermal emission in relativistic jets.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05359v1">Resonant Drag Instabilities for Polydisperse Dust, I. The Acoustic Resonant Drag Instability</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-03-07</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sijme-Jan Paardekooper, Hossam Aly</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The study reveals that when accounting for a continuous spectrum of grain sizes, the acoustic resonant drag instability transitions from fast-growing perturbations (∝√μ) in monodisperse cases to slower growth (∝μ) due to integrated gas backreaction and stabilization of large wave numbers, leading to reduced exponential growth rates in polydisperse regimes.</p>

        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-03-07</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Jia Zhao, Jing-fu Hu</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The study of radio galaxy 3C 348 using simulations and spectral analysis suggests that accretion mode transitions (from a standard thin disc to ADAF) and central engine dynamics, rather than viewing angles, primarily explain FR I/II differences, revealing obscured nuclear regions, lower accretion rates, and jet power evolution linked to the central engine.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05302v1">Turbulence Induced Non-Gaussian Spectral Distortion in the Microwave Sky from Photon-Axion Conversion in Galaxy Clusters</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-03-07</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harsh Mehta, Suvodip Mukherjee</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study introduces a numerical simulation technique demonstrating that photon-axion conversion in galaxy clusters generates non-Gaussian temperature and polarization distortions in the CMB, influenced by turbulent electron density and magnetic fields, enabling future experiments to probe axion-photon coupling for masses between \(10^{-14}\) eV and \(10^{-11}\) eV through synergistic CMB, X-ray, and radio analyses.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05261v1">A Possible Common Physic Picture Reflected by the Gamma Ray Emission of the Galactic Center</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-03-07</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lin Nie, Yi-Qing Guo, Si-Ming Liu</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The study explains the Galactic center's observed double power-law gamma-ray spectrum (GeV from trapped background cosmic rays interacting with dense gas and TeV from protons accelerated during active phases), supporting a model where high-energy cosmic rays originate locally and low-energy ones from distant sources, predicting that some extended Galactic sources undetectable in GeV may become observable in TeV.</p>

        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A study using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) from August 2022 to October 2023 observed the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar Aql X-1 during quiescence and outburst states, detecting no pulsed emissions but achieving the lowest upper flux density limits (2.86–5.73 µJy) to date, suggesting radio-ejection state absorption by surrounding matter as a likely mechanism hindering detection.</p>

        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-03-07</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruisong Xia, Hao Liu, Yongquan Xue</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A study of the active galactic nucleus RE J1034+396 using XMM-Newton data reveals that its X-ray quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) exhibits amplitude modulation in both soft and hard bands with a 17 ks timescale, showing a correlated soft flux and hard QPO presence with a ~3 ks lag, providing new insights into corona components and evolving cross-correlation lags potentially linked to prior QPO frequency and lag evolution observations.</p>
