        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05444v1">The soft X-ray transient EP241021a: a cosmic explosion with a complex off-axis jet and cocoon from a massive progenitor</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulia Gianfagna, Luigi Piro, Gabriele Bruni, Aishwarya Linesh Thakur, Hendrik Van Eerten, Alberto Castro-Tirado, Yong Chen, Ye-hao Cheng, Han He, Shumei Jia, Zhixing Ling, Elisabetta Maiorano, Rosita Paladino, Roberta Tripodi, Andrea Rossi, Shuaikang Yang, Jianghui Yuan, Weimin Yuan, Chen Zhang</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The multi-wavelength analysis of X-ray flash EP241021a's afterglow reveals multiple components shaped by jet interactions with the progenitor's environment, indicating a structured evolution from a relativistic narrow jet to broader cocoons, supporting collapsar models such as off-axis GRBs or baryon-loaded explosions.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05429v1">Theoretical modeling of approximate universality of tidally deformed neutron stars</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takuya Katagiri, Gowtham Rishi Mukkamala, Kent Yagi</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study employs a semi-analytic model extending the Tolman VII solution to confirm that quasi-universal relations among neutron star tidal deformabilities—arising from low compressibility—align with empirical findings, supporting their use in gravitational-wave modeling to infer nuclear matter properties and test General Relativity.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05400v1">Significant reflection and absorption effects in the X-ray emission of the Intermediate Polar IGR J17195-4100</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elif Şafak, Şölen Balman, Gloria Sala</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The study investigates absorption and scattering effects in the X-ray emission of the intermediate polar IGR J17195-4100 using combined NuSTAR and XMM-Newton spectral analysis, revealing a multi-temperature plasma (~27 keV), reflection, ionized and neutral absorption, and electron scattering-induced modulation (9-15%), emphasizing their critical role in accurately modeling intrinsic spectra.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05373v1">Late-blooming magnetars: awakening as ultra-long period objects after a dormant cooling epoch</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur G. Suvorov, Clara Dehman, José A. Pons</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Ultra-long period transients (ULPs), potentially explained as "late-blooming" magnetars, arise when electric currents in a neutron star's core during crust freezing lead to an initial ∼0.1 Myr passive cooling phase, followed by Hall-driven crustal failures that trigger radio pulses and rotational energy depletion, distinguishing them from other magnetar classes like soft gamma repeaters.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05322v1">The Emergence of Little Red Dots from Binary Massive Black Holes</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohei Inayoshi, Jinyi Shangguan, Xian Chen, Luis C. Ho, Zoltan Haiman</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The study proposes that the distinctive v-shaped spectra of high-redshift little red dots (LRDs) arise from compact binary black holes with circum-binary and mini-disks, where spectral features emerge from disk structures and modest dust attenuation, resolving luminosity overestimations and aligning with the Soltan argument, while predicting spectral evolution through orbital decay that connects early AGN phases to gravitational wave-emitting mergers.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05299v1">Hydrodynamic and Electromagnetic Discrepancies between Neutron Star and Black Hole Spacetimes</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Gorard, James Juno, Ammar Hakim</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The exterior spacetime of Kerr black holes depends only on mass and spin, but neutron stars exhibit higher multipole moments influenced by their equation of state, with simulations revealing significant impacts on accretion dynamics and electromagnetic fields near their surfaces, highlighting limitations in using the Kerr metric for neutron star simulations.</p>

        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhimanyu Susobhanan, Rutger van Haasteren</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper introduces a generalized method to incorporate arbitrary models of dispersion measure (DM) variation, including Gaussian processes, into pulsar timing and noise analysis, enhancing the handling of frequency-dependent effects in wideband datasets and improving upon existing approaches for pulsar timing arrays.</p>

        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zuhua Ji, Jiarui Chen, Gaojian Wu</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This review explores the equation of state (EoS) for neutron stars—critical to astrophysics, nuclear physics, and quantum chromodynamics (QCD)—by categorizing models into hadronic, hybrid, and quark matter types, evaluating their assumptions, predictions, and constraints, and integrating recent theoretical and observational insights to outline methodologies, implications, and future research directions.</p>

        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Run-Ting Huang, Long Ji, Jing-Zhi Yan</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The 2021 giant outburst in the high-mass X-ray binary EXO 2030+375 triggered a dramatic orbital phase shift in its Type-I outbursts from near periastron to 20 days post-periastron, followed by gradual recovery and intermittent missing outbursts recurring every two orbits, explained by precession of an eccentric Be disk.</p>

        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niek Bollemeijer, Phil Uttley, Bei You</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The August 2023 outburst of black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8-1613, observed across 0.5–150 keV, revealed energy-dependent quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) waveforms driven by a spectral pivot near 15–20 keV, distinct phase lags at harmonic frequencies linked to broadband noise, and differing variability components extracted via bispectrum and cross-spectrum analyses, with similarities to MAXI J1535-571 suggesting these properties may characterize a subset of such systems.</p>
