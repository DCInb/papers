        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05444v1">The soft X-ray transient EP241021a: a cosmic explosion with a complex off-axis jet and cocoon from a massive progenitor</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulia Gianfagna, Luigi Piro, Gabriele Bruni, Aishwarya Linesh Thakur, Hendrik Van Eerten, Alberto Castro-Tirado, Yong Chen, Ye-hao Cheng, Han He, Shumei Jia, Zhixing Ling, Elisabetta Maiorano, Rosita Paladino, Roberta Tripodi, Andrea Rossi, Shuaikang Yang, Jianghui Yuan, Weimin Yuan, Chen Zhang</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents multi-wavelength observations of the X-ray Flash EP241021a's afterglow, revealing multiple components shaped by jet-environment interactions in a collapsar scenario, which suggests XRFs are soft Gamma-Ray Burst analogs with structures ranging from relativistic jets to broader cocoons.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05429v1">Theoretical modeling of approximate universality of tidally deformed neutron stars</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takuya Katagiri, Gowtham Rishi Mukkamala, Kent Yagi</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study demonstrates that neutron stars exhibit quasi-universal relations among tidal deformabilities, such as the I-Love relation, due to low compressibility, validated through a semi-analytic Tolman VII-based model, enabling simplified gravitational-wave modeling and enhanced nuclear matter insights while minimizing equation-of-state dependence.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05400v1">Significant reflection and absorption effects in the X-ray emission of the Intermediate Polar IGR J17195-4100</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elif Şafak, Şölen Balman, Gloria Sala</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The study of the Intermediate Polar IGR J17195-4100 using combined NuSTAR and XMM-Newton data (0.3-78.0 keV) reveals that its X-ray spectrum is best modeled with reflection, ionized and neutral absorption, a multi-temperature plasma (∼27 keV), and electron scattering effects, which significantly influence emission characteristics and must be considered for accurate spectral representation.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05373v1">Late-blooming magnetars: awakening as ultra-long period objects after a dormant cooling epoch</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur G. Suvorov, Clara Dehman, José A. Pons</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Magnetothermal modeling suggests that ultra-long period transients (ULPs) arise from "late-blooming" magnetars, where core electric currents during crust freezing lead to an initial ~0.1 Myr dormant phase, followed by crustal cooling-induced Hall-effect-driven failures that trigger radio pulses and slow rotation, forming a distinct class separate from soft gamma repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05322v1">The Emergence of Little Red Dots from Binary Massive Black Holes</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohei Inayoshi, Jinyi Shangguan, Xian Chen, Luis C. Ho, Zoltan Haiman</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The study proposes that Little Red Dots (LRDs), characterized by red optical and blue UV spectra, originate from compact binary black hole systems with mini-disks and a circum-binary disk, where binary torques create spectral gaps resolving luminosity overestimations and aligning with the Soltan argument, while predicting evolutionary links to gravitational wave sources as the binary orbit decays.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05299v1">Hydrodynamic and Electromagnetic Discrepancies between Neutron Star and Black Hole Spacetimes</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2025-05-08</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Gorard, James Juno, Ammar Hakim</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The study demonstrates that neutron stars' spacetime, influenced by equation-of-state-dependent higher multipole moments, leads to significant discrepancies in accretion dynamics and electromagnetic fields compared to Kerr metric black holes, challenging its use in neutron star simulations and impacting phenomena like gravitational collapse and jet launching.</p>

        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhimanyu Susobhanan, Rutger van Haasteren</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The authors propose a generalized method to incorporate arbitrary dispersion measure (DM) variation models, including Gaussian processes, into pulsar timing and pulsar timing array analyses, enhancing existing wideband approaches that measure DM and arrival times to mitigate interstellar medium-induced delays and data challenges.</p>

        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Run-Ting Huang, Long Ji, Jing-Zhi Yan</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper reports another orbital phase shift in the high-mass X-ray binary EXO 2030+375, triggered by a 2021 giant outburst that moved Type-I outburst peaks from near periastron to 20 days post-periastron with gradual recovery, followed by missing outbursts recurring every two orbits, interpreted as resulting from precession of an eccentric Be disk.</p>

        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niek Bollemeijer, Phil Uttley, Bei You</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In August 2023, the bright black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8-1613 exhibited energy-dependent type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with a spectral pivot around 15–20 keV, distinct phase lags at fundamental and harmonic frequencies, and differing variability components identified via bispectrum and cross-spectrum analyses, showing similarities to MAXI J1535-571 and suggesting common QPO properties in some BHXRBs.</p>
